					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						This is a Emergency Simulation System made using java 
						which genarates and displays the emergenices based on 
						the input text file and also recives updates from responders 
						on the sate of the emergency.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="two">
					<h2>How the application works</h2>
					<p> 
						When a fire emergency is created it is created with an idle state when the 
						runtime is equal to the start time it switches to low intensity from idle 
						and switches to high intensity if there are no responders. If responders are present 
						and fire is at low intensity it changes to the inactive state after low to end time. 
						If responders are present at a fire with high intensity state changes from high to low to inactive.<br/>

						Flood and chemical emergencies have the states idle active and inactive when runtime is equal to the 
						start time it switches from idle to active and if responders are present the state will change from 
						active to inactive depending on the end time.

					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="three">
					<h2>Object oriented design patterns used</h2>
						<p>
							Observer pattern was used to update the time values in all the emergencies created in real time.<br/>

							State pattern was used to set states to fire flood and chemical emergencies.
